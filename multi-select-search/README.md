**API Endpoint:** You can use this [API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/tags) to fetch skills.

## Requirements

- Provide a search input for users to filter the data.
- Allow users to select multiple options from the list.

## Taking your Project to the Next Level

- Show a loading spinner while data is being fetched from the API.
